    - def_name: show_recorder_collisions
      params:
      - param_name: filename

          Name of the recorded file to load

          Character specifying the category of the first actor
      - param_name: category2
        type: single char
        doc: >
          Character specifying the category of the second actor
      doc: >
        This will show which collisions were recorded in the file. We can use a filter for the collisions we want, using two categories.
        The categories can be:  
          'h' = Hero  
          'v' = Vehicle  
          'w' = Walker  
          't' = Traffic light  
          'o' = Other  
          'a' = Any  
        So, if you want to see only collisions about a vehicle and a walker, we would use for category1 'v' and category2 'w'.
        Or if you want all the collisions (filter off) you can use 'a' as both categories.

        doc: >
          How many seconds has to be stoped an actor to be considered as blocked
      - param_name: min_distance
        type: float
        doc: >
          How many centimeters needs to move the actor in order to be considered as moving, and not blocked
      doc: >
        Shows which actors seem blocked by some reason.
        The idea is to calculate which actors are not moving as much as 'min_distance' for a period of 'min_time'.
        By default min_time = 60 seconds (1 min) and min_distance = 100 centimeters (1 m).

          A value of 1.0 means normal time factor.
          A value < 1.0 means slow motion (for example 0.5 is half speed)
          A value > 1.0 means fast motion (for example 2.0 is double speed)

          A list of commands to execute in batch. Each command has a different number of parameters.
          Currently, we can use these [commands](#command.ApplyAngularVelocity):

        We don't have control about the response of each command. If we need that, we can use `apply_batch_sync()`.

        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation
        step, blocks until the commands are executed, and returns a list of
        [`command.Response`](#command.Response) that can be used to determine whether a single
        command succeeded or not.

  - class_name: TrafficManager
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The traffic manager is a module built on top of the CARLA API in C++. It handles any group of vehicles set to autopilot mode to populate the simulation with realistic urban traffic conditions and give the chance to user to customize some behaviours. The architecture of the traffic manager is divided in five different goal-oriented stages and a PID controller where the information flows until eventually, a carla.VehicleControl is applied to every vehicle registered in a traffic manager.  
      
      In order to learn more, visit the [documentation](../traffic_manager) regarding this module.
